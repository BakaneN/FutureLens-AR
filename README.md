# FutureLens-AR

FUTURE LENS AUGMENTED REALITY (AR)
See your future, one career at a time


Introduction

The Project

Almost every child has been asked what they want to be when they grow up. It is remarkable how children are expected to explain how they will provide for their families, despite having little to no exposure to the working world. Appropriate guidance often comes too late, leaving many young adults to make uninformed decisions. FutureLens AR aims to bridge this gap through simulations, allowing children to explore different professions and skills in a hands-on and engaging manner while they are still young.
